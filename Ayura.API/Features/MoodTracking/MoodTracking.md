# User Mood Tracking and Analysis

## Introduction

This documentation outlines the process of collecting and analyzing user moods through the frontend interface, storing
them in the database, associating tips with different moods, and analyzing mood variations to provide relevant tips.

## User Mood Collection

1. **Getting User Moods from Frontend:**
   The frontend interface collects user moods as JSON data. These moods are typically represented as a set of emotions
   or feelings that the user selects or inputs. When user inputs a mood, it will be sent to backend with date, time and
   mood

```json
{
  "date": "2021-10-10",
  "time": "12:00",
  "mood": "happy",
   "mood_weight": "5"
}
```

2. **Storing Moods in the Database:**
   Moods are stored within a separate collection in the database. Each mood entry includes the mood name, date, and any
   associated tips. This separation allows efficient organization and retrieval of mood data.

## Mood Storage in User Collection

1. **Storing Moods in User Collection:**
   The collected user moods are linked to the user's profile and stored within the user collection. Each mood entry
   includes the date and the moods experienced by the user on that day. This provides a historical record of the user's
   moods over time.

## Storing Tips for Each Mood

1. **Storing Tips in Mood Collection:**
   Within the mood collection, there is an association between each mood and a set of tips related to that mood. These
   tips provide users with suggestions on how to manage or enhance their mood. Each tip entry includes a description and
   possibly additional information.

## Mood Analysis and Tip Retrieval

1. **Analyzing Mood Variations:**
   The backend system performs analysis on the collected mood data to identify variations and patterns over time. This
   analysis can help in understanding trends in the user's mood and its potential impact on their well-being.

2. **Retrieving Relevant Tips:**
   Based on the analyzed mood data, the system retrieves relevant tips associated with specific moods. For instance, if
   a user has been experiencing low moods consistently, the system can suggest tips to improve their mood and mental
   state.

## Summary

The user mood tracking and analysis feature provides insights into users' emotional well-being by collecting and storing
their moods. Tips associated with different moods offer personalized suggestions for users to manage their emotions. By
analyzing mood variations, the system offers valuable recommendations to enhance users' mental health and overall mood.

This documentation comprehensively outlines the process of implementing mood tracking, tip association, mood analysis,
